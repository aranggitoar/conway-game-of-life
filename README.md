# Conway's Game of Life

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C with the simulation world run
in the command line as a printed square grid. The [original basic
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is quite
simple, it took less than an hour to write, more interesting logic might
be explored in the future.

Run it with:
```bash
make r
```
